# Modules

This folder is where we will put all our modules. 
The modules in here should be highly reusable. 
You should be able to copy and paste them in a different project and have no issues apart from referencing nuget packages.

### Constraints

- Modules must be self-contained. 
- Modules must not reference any other application code
- Modules must only reference System, Microsoft and select Nuget packages
